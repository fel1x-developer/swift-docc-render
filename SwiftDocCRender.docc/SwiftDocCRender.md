# ``SwiftDocCRender``

A web renderer for DocC Archives produced by DocC.

## Overview

DocC-Render displays documentation produced by [DocC](https://www.swift.org/documentation/docc) on the web and is included in DocC Archives.

### How It Works

DocC-Render is a Single Page Application (SPA for short), powered by [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). SPAs are web apps that are rendered entirely in the browser using JavaScript. Pages and content are generated dynamically at runtime, based on DocC generated Render JSON data.
